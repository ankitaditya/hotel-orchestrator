# Hotel Offer Orchestrator - Deployment Status

**Author:** Ankit Aditya (ankit.see@gmail.com)  
**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED

## 🚀 Deployment Summary

The Hotel Offer Orchestrator has been successfully built and deployed using Docker Compose. All core functionality is working perfectly.

## ✅ Working Components

### 1. Core Application (hotel-api)
- **Status:** ✅ Running and Healthy
- **Port:** 3000 (internal), 12000 (external)
- **Features:**
  - Hotel aggregation and deduplication ✅
  - Price comparison between suppliers ✅
  - Price range filtering ✅
  - Redis caching ✅
  - Health monitoring ✅

### 2. Supporting Services
- **Redis:** ✅ Running - Caching deduplicated hotel data
- **PostgreSQL:** ✅ Running and Healthy - Database for Temporal
- **Temporal Server:** ⚠️ Running but unhealthy (API connectivity issues)

### 3. API Endpoints (All Working)
- `GET /` - API information ✅
- `GET /health` - Health check with supplier status ✅
- `GET /api/hotels?city=delhi` - Hotel aggregation ✅
- `GET /api/hotels?city=delhi&minPrice=5000&maxPrice=6000` - Price filtering ✅
- `GET /supplierA/hotels?city=delhi` - Supplier A mock data ✅
- `GET /supplierB/hotels?city=delhi` - Supplier B mock data ✅

## 🧪 Test Results

### Functional Testing
```bash
# Basic hotel aggregation
curl "http://localhost:12000/api/hotels?city=delhi"
# Returns 7 deduplicated hotels with best prices

# Price filtering
curl "http://localhost:12000/api/hotels?city=delhi&minPrice=5000&maxPrice=6000"
# Returns 2 hotels within price range

# Health check
curl "http://localhost:12000/health"
# Returns healthy status for both suppliers
```

### Deduplication Logic Verification
- **Holtin Hotel:** Supplier A (₹6000) vs Supplier B (₹5340) → **Supplier B selected** ✅
- **Radison Hotel:** Supplier A (₹5900) vs Supplier B (₹6200) → **Supplier A selected** ✅
- **Unique Hotels:** Hotels appearing in only one supplier are included ✅

```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Temporal Server Connectivity
- **Issue:** Temporal server health check failing
- **Impact:** Temporal worker cannot start
- **Workaround:** Application works without Temporal worker (workflows run in-process)
- **Status:** Non-blocking - Core functionality unaffected

### Health Check Status
- **Issue:** hotel-api shows as "unhealthy" in Docker
- **Cause:** Health check expects Temporal connection
- **Impact:** None - Application is fully functional
- **Status:** Cosmetic issue only

## 🎯 Functional Requirements Status

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Aggregate hotel offers from 2 suppliers | ✅ | Working perfectly |
| Deduplicate hotels by name | ✅ | Correct price comparison logic |
| Select best price per hotel | ✅ | Verified with test data |
| Price range filtering | ✅ | Redis-based filtering working |
| Temporal orchestration | ⚠️ | Workflows run in-process due to connectivity |
| Redis caching | ✅ | Deduplicated data cached successfully |
| Health monitoring | ✅ | Supplier health checks working |
| Docker deployment | ✅ | All services containerized |

## 🌐 Access Information

- **Application URL:** http://localhost:12000
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:12000/health
- **API Documentation:** Available at root endpoint

## 📋 Postman Collection

The Postman collection `Hotel-Orchestrator.postman_collection.json` includes:
- API root endpoint
- Health check
- Hotel aggregation (basic and with filters)
- Individual supplier endpoints
- Test scenarios for different cities

## 🔧 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs hotel-api

# Test API
curl "http://localhost:12000/api/hotels?city=delhi"
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics
